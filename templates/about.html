    <p>
        <b>CyberMadad</b> is a cyber-fraud support and awareness platform designed to
        help individuals who have been affected by online scams, phishing attacks,
        fake websites, and other forms of digital fraud.
    </p>

    <p>
        In today’s digital world, cyber crimes are increasing rapidly, while law-enforcement
        agencies are often overloaded with cases. CyberMadad aims to bridge this gap by
        providing a structured platform where victims can report incidents and receive
        guidance from trained cybersecurity students and researchers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our platform works strictly on <b>ethical and legal principles</b>. All investigations
        are conducted using <b>OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)</b> techniques only.
        We do not perform hacking, illegal access, or intrusive activities of any kind.
    </p>

    <p>
        Victim privacy and data security are our top priorities. Personal details are shared
        with investigators <b>only when the victim gives explicit consent</b>.
        CyberMadad is <b>not a law-enforcement agency</b> and does not replace official
        cyber crime reporting channels.
